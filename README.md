# Strikers_CV - Traffic Sign Recognition Project


## Overview

Welcome to the Strikers_CV project on Traffic Sign Classification. This project aims to build and evaluate various models for classifying traffic signs using deep learning techniques.

## Project Structure

The project contains the following components:

- `Traffic_Sign_Classifier_Striker.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the main code for building and training the traffic sign recognition models.

- `VGG_saved_model`: Directory containing the saved model of the VGG approach.

- `LeNet_saved_model`: Directory containing the saved model of the LeNet architecture.

- `LeNet_saved_model_balanced`: Directory containing the saved model of the balanced version of the LeNet architecture.

- `Modified_saved_model`: Directory containing the saved model of the modified LeNet architecture.

- `Modified_saved_model_balanced`: Directory containing the saved model of the balanced version of the modified LeNet architecture.

- `Modified_saved_model_svm`: Directory containing the model that combines the LeNet architecture with Support Vector Machine (SVM).

- `notebook_images`: Directory containing images used in the Jupyter notebook for demonstration and visualization.

- `traffic-signs-data`: Directory containing the dataset used for training and testing the models.

- `yolov5s_model`: Directory containing the YOLOv5s model used for traffic sign detection.

- `yolov5s_results`: Directory containing the results of the YOLOv5s model.

## Getting Started

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository

2. Navigate to the project directory.

3. Install the required dependencies (you can find them in the Jupyter notebook).

4. Open the Jupyter notebook `Traffic_Sign_Classifier_Striker.ipynb`.

5. Execute the notebook cells sequentially to train and evaluate the traffic sign recognition models.

## Results

After running the notebook, you will obtain trained models and their corresponding evaluation results. The performance metrics and visualizations will be presented for each model, allowing you to compare their performance.
